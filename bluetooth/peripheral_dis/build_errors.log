warning: UART_CONSOLE (defined at drivers/console/Kconfig:42) was assigned the value 'y' but got the
value 'n'. Check these unsatisfied dependencies: SERIAL_HAS_DRIVER (=n). See
http://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/kconfig.html#CONFIG_UART_CONSOLE and/or look up UART_CONSOLE in
the menuconfig/guiconfig interface. The Application Development Primer, Setting Configuration
Values, and Kconfig - Tips and Best Practices sections of the manual might be helpful too.
